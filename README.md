# Hello Wasm

Minimal .NET 10 WebAssembly sample without Blazor. The `src/` folder holds the C# entry point plus the tiny HTML/JS host so you can run plain C# client-side, while `build/` and `publish/` keep compiler output separate from your source.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 10 (already installed per user)
- WebAssembly build tools once per machine:
  ```sh
  dotnet workload install wasm-tools
  ```
- Optional: [`dotnet-serve`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-serve) for quickly hosting the published bundle.

## Build

```sh
cd C:/temp/HelloWasm
dotnet publish src/HelloWasm.csproj -c Release -r browser-wasm /p:UseAppHost=false
```

This drops intermediate build assets under `build/` and automatically mirrors the generated WebAssembly run bundle into the top-level `publish/` folder (so you can serve from a stable path).

## Run locally

1. Serve the `publish/` output with any static server. Example:
   ```sh
   dotnet serve --directory publish --port 5000
   ```
2. Browse to `http://localhost:5000`. The `<pre>` element mirrors the text printed by `Console.WriteLine`.

## Folder layout

```
HelloWasm/
├─ README.md
├─ src/
│  ├─ HelloWasm.csproj
│  ├─ Program.cs
│  └─ wwwroot/
│     ├─ app.js
│     └─ index.html
├─ build/        # auto-generated by dotnet publish (bin/obj equivalent)
└─ publish/      # final static WebAssembly assets ready to host
```

## Notes

- `Program.cs` uses top-level statements; anything you print with `Console.WriteLine` shows in the browser.
- The JavaScript host simply loads the generated `dotnet.js` runtime from the publish bundle and forwards `console.log` output into the page.
- Deploy by copying the `publish/` folder (with your customized `index.html`/`app.js`) to any static host (GitHub Pages, Azure Static Web Apps, etc.).
